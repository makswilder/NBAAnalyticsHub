# NBA Analytics Hub üèÄ

NBA Player Analytics Hub is a full-stack web app built to help users explore detailed NBA player stats. It pulls data for 500+ players, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and provides various filters and sorting options to analyze performance. The backend is built with Spring Boot and secured with JWT-based auth, while the frontend uses React for a clean and interactive UI. Regular users can browse data, while authorised users can create, update, and delete players.
